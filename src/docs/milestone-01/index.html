        <section id="overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>In a world where finding local businesses efficiently is increasingly challenging, our team aims to design and develop a web application called "Locality." Targeting both locals and travelers, Locality seeks to bridge this gap by providing a seamless platform to connect users with nearby businesses. Our vision is to make discovering and supporting local businesses straightforward and intuitive, regardless of whether users are in familiar surroundings or exploring new areas.</p>
            <p> By leveraging the power of technology Locality aims to enhance the user experience by offering real-time, personalized business recommendations based on the user's location and preferences. Our primary focus is on fostering community engagement and supporting the local economy, making every location feel like home by providing immediate access to the resources and services users need, when they need them most.</p>

        <section id="application-parts">
            <h2>Key Components</h2>            
            <p><strong>Interactive Map:</strong> Serving as a central feature, the Interactive Map provides users with a dynamic and immersive experience in discovering local businesses. Real-time geolocation tracking enables users to view their surroundings with pinpointed businesses, offering a sense of what's nearby. Custom filters and search criteria refine search results, ensuring users find exactly what they need.</p>
            <p><strong>Business Profiles:</strong> This component offers detailed pages for each listed local business, including essential information such as business hours, contact details, services offered, and user reviews. Integrated with Google Places API, these profiles are enriched with authentic and up-to-date data, facilitating informed decision-making by the user.</p>
            <p><strong>Customizable Filter Function:</strong> Empowering users to tailor their search based on specific preferences such as business type, ratings, distance, or open hours. This functionality enhances the user experience by delivering personalized results and promotes local businesses by highlighting those that match user preferences and needs.</p>

        <section id="data-requirements">
            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            <p>Localityâ€™s functionality is underpinned by diverse and complex data requirements essential for delivering a seamless and enriching user experience. At the forefront is the need for a robust and comprehensive database of local businesses, incorporating data such as names, locations, contact information, operating hours, and services offered. This database is crucial for powering the app's search and discovery features.</p>
            <p>User Data is another vital component, encompassing profiles, preferences, search history, and reviews. Secure handling and storage of this data are paramount, with a focus on privacy and personalized user experiences. Integrating user feedback and reviews into business profiles not only aids other users but also fosters a community around local support and feedback.</p>
            <p>Real-time Geolocation Data is essential for the interactive map feature, requiring precise and current location tracking to provide users with accurate information about their surroundings and nearby businesses. This data must be processed efficiently to ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface.</p>
            <p>Finally, the application will leverage API Data from Google Maps and Google Places to enrich the local business data with additional details like photos, user ratings, and reviews. This integration ensures that Locality offers the most comprehensive and up-to-date information available.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>1. We have our main Interactive Map screen, that conceptualizes the geolocation usage to display what's around users at the moment.

            </p>
            <p>
                2. Now we have our Quick Links and Broader Filter function, which displays what the user needs to see right after users click on them. These quick links are determined by using widely used and searched for categories, however the filter expands things more.

            </p>
            <p> 3. Our User Profile will detail a restauarnt, how far it is, how much or a walk/drive it will be and their ratings. Restaurants can choose to include Menus, prices, for example. A Book Store would similarly, include their website or database tto search for their available books.
