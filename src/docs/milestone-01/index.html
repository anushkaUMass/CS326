        <section id="overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>In today's fast-paced world, finding local businesses that cater to your specific needs can be a time-consuming task, especially when you're in unfamiliar surroundings. Locality aims to bridge this gap by offering a seamless, user-friendly web application designed to connect users with local businesses at the touch of a button. Leveraging the power of Google Maps API, Google Places API, and the Geolocation API, Locality provides real-time, personalized business recommendations based on the user's location and preferences. Whether it's a cozy café, a reliable mechanic, or an urgent care facility, Locality makes discovering and supporting local businesses straightforward and intuitive.</p>
            <p>Targeted towards locals and travelers alike, Locality addresses the real-world problem of finding quality, convenient services and goods nearby. By fostering a stronger connection between consumers and local enterprises, Locality not only supports the local economy but also enhances the user's experience in their community or while traveling. The essence of Locality is to make every location feel like home, by providing immediate access to the resources and services users need, when they need them most.</p>

        <section id="application-parts">
            <h2>Key Components</h2>
            <p>The Interactive Map is a central feature of Locality, designed to provide users with a dynamic and immersive experience in discovering local businesses. Through real-time geolocation tracking, users can view their surroundings on the map with pinpointed businesses, offering an immediate sense of what's around them. Custom filters and search criteria refine search results, ensuring users find exactly what they need, be it a late-night pharmacy or a vegan restaurant.</p>
            <p>Business Profiles form another critical component, offering detailed pages for each listed local business. These profiles include essential information such as business hours, contact details, services offered, and user reviews. Integrating with Google Places API, Locality enriches these profiles with authentic and up-to-date data, thereby facilitating informed decision-making by the user.</p>
            <p>A Customizable Filter Function stands out as a pivotal element, empowering users to tailor their search based on specific preferences such as business type, ratings, distance, or open hours. This functionality not only enhances the user experience by delivering personalized results but also promotes local businesses by highlighting those that match user preferences and needs.</p>

        <section id="data-requirements">
            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            <p>Locality’s functionality is underpinned by diverse and complex data requirements essential for delivering a seamless and enriching user experience. At the forefront is the need for a robust and comprehensive database of local businesses, incorporating data such as names, locations, contact information, operating hours, and services offered. This database is crucial for powering the app's search and discovery features.</p>
            <p>User Data is another vital component, encompassing profiles, preferences, search history, and reviews. Secure handling and storage of this data are paramount, with a focus on privacy and personalized user experiences. Integrating user feedback and reviews into business profiles not only aids other users but also fosters a community around local support and feedback.</p>
            <p>Real-time Geolocation Data is essential for the interactive map feature, requiring precise and current location tracking to provide users with accurate information about their surroundings and nearby businesses. This data must be processed efficiently to ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface.</p>
            <p>Finally, the application will leverage API Data from Google Maps and Google Places to enrich the local business data with additional details like photos, user ratings, and reviews. This integration ensures that Locality offers the most comprehensive and up-to-date information available.</p>

        <section id="wire-frames">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Due to the interactive nature of this proposal, wireframes and their descriptions will be conceptualized to illustrate the user interface design and functionality of key application screens. These include the Home Screen with the interactive map and search bar, Business Profiles showing detailed information, a Filter Screen for refining searches, and User Profile pages for personalized experiences. Each wireframe supports the application’s goal of providing a user-friendly and intuitive platform for discovering local businesses.</p>
